my program is a tool to give you a suggestion of what to do while bored and stuck at home.

it is a simple python program, get the files from the "program" folder and run the "main.py" file and it will return a random suggestion.

I have populated a few suggestions to get started, but more can be added.

New contributions can be easily added to the list of suggestions by editing the "things.txt" file.

type each suggestion and then hit return before entering the next one.
