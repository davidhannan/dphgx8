## Community Call:
- I am planning on attending the the value working group community call on April 9th.

## Reflection:
I thought it was quite interesting hearing how these people came to be involved in the CHAOSS group as well as the origin of the group itself. 
Since I'm not at all experienced/involved in the proffessional world at this point it was interesting to see how things like this project come about and to know their value in the real world.
