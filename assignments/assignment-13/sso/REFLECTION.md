I looked at Sails and Ory Hydra. Sails runs on node js and Ory Hydra runs in a docker container. I have a little expereince with Docker so I chose to go with Ory Hydra.

I followed a tutorial to get a login page set up and was able to complete it, resulting in a fucntioning login page. 
The only real obstacle that I ran into was trying to install docker on Windows at first. Apparently you can only install it on certain versions of windows 10 and mine wasnt one of them. I solved this issue by doing it in linux instead.
